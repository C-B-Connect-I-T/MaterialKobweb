/**
 * Base class for all ViewModels in the application.
 * 
 * Provides lifecycle management through automatic coroutine cancellation when disposed.
 * This class should be extended by all ViewModel classes, regardless of whether
 * they use the MVI pattern or another architecture pattern.
 * 
 * The [coroutineScope] is lazily initialized on first access and provides a stable
 * instance throughout the ViewModel's lifetime. This follows the pattern used by
 * Android's ViewModel.viewModelScope.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * class MyViewModel : ViewModel(), MVI<State, Intent, Effect> {
 *     // coroutineScope is automatically available via lazy initialization
 *     
 *     override fun sendIntent(intent: Intent) = coroutineScope.launch {
 *         // Handle intent
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * To customize the coroutine scope configuration, override [createCoroutineScope]:
 * ```
 * class MyViewModel : ViewModel(), MVI<State, Intent, Effect> {
 *     override fun createCoroutineScope(): CoroutineScope {
 *         return CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

     * - The ViewModel is evicted from ViewModelStore (LRU eviction)
     * - rememberViewModel is called with cached = false and the composable is disposed
     * - ViewModelStore.remove() is called explicitly
     * - ViewModelStore.clear() is called

     * The default implementation cancels the [coroutineScope] if it has been initialized.
     * Override this method if you need additional cleanup logic, but make sure
     * to call super.dispose() to ensure the coroutine scope is cancelled.

     * ```
     * override fun dispose() {

     *     myListener.remove()
     *     super.dispose()
