/**
 * Remember a ViewModel with a stable key that persists across navigation.
 *
 * This is specifically designed for Kobweb/Compose for Web where browser back/forward
 * navigation unmounts and remounts the entire composition, which would normally
 * cause ViewModels to be recreated.
 *
 * The [key] defaults to the current page's `pathQueryAndFragment` (path + query string + fragment),
 * which uniquely identifies the page including any dynamic route parameters and query string.
 * Override it when you need to share a single ViewModel across multiple pages, or when
 * a component-level (rather than page-level) key is more appropriate.
 *
 * **Important**: This function caches ViewModels globally. For pages where you don't want
 * caching (e.g., create/edit forms), use `cached = false` instead.
 *
 * @param key Unique key for this ViewModel instance. Defaults to the current page's path + query + fragment.
 * @param cached If true (default), the ViewModel is stored in [ViewModelStore] and survives navigation.
 *               If false, a fresh instance is created every time and disposed when the composable leaves composition.
 * @param factory Lambda to create the ViewModel if not already cached.
 * @return The ViewModel instance.
